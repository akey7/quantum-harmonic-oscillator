## Dependency Installation

The following directions work for macOS. These instructions will be largely the same for Windows.

### Once before you run source the first time

```
conda create -n quantum-harmonic-oscillator python=3.11
conda activate quantum-harmonic-oscillator
conda install jupyterlab matplotlib numpy scipy black
```

### Every other time you want to run the code

Before you use it:

```
conda activate quantum-harmonic-oscillator
```

After you are done:

```
conda deactivate
